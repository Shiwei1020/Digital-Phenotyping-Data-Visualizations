# Digital-Phenotyping-Data-Visualizations
Sample Code for Clinical Visualization of Digital Phenotyping Data

Digital phenotyping is increasingly utilized in psychiatric clinics, particularly in digital interventions, to improve treatment outcomes. However, a critical gap remains in how this data is shared, interpreted, and integrated into clinical workflows. While previous efforts have focused on visualizing statistical data, many approaches lack accessibility, flexibility, and adaptability for diverse clinical needs. To address these challenges, we developed a structured visualization framework that translates raw digital phenotyping data into meaningful insights, enhancing communication between clinicians and patients.
